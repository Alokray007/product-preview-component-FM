### What I have learned
[:is()] pseudo class function takes a selector list as its argument, and selects any element that can be selected by one of the selectors in that list.

[].visually-hidden:not(:focus):not(:active)] class can be used to hide content visually but it will be helpful for screen readers.

[::before] creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element.

[media="(min-width:600px)"] Learned how to use media to use image for a specific width.
